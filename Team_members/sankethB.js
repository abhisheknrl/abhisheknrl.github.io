		<h4><strong>Tagore Sanketh Bandaru, MSc</strong></h4>
		PhD Student<br><br>
		<p style="font-size:80%;">
			Sanketh joined the lab in 2023 and started his PhD in 2024. His research uses single-cell transcriptomics datasets to identify gene regulatory networks dysregulated in clonal hematopoiesis(CH). He is also involved in the analysis of whole-genome sequencing data from Genomics England cohort to idenitfy somatic structural variations associated with CH and disease risk.
            He completed his Master's degree in Molecular Life Sciences at Karolinska Institute, where his thesis used single-cell RNA-seq data to study intra-tumoral heterogeneity in basal cell carcinoma. His work combines single-cell analysis, bioinformatics, and cancer genomics to better understand mechanisms driving cancer and age-related clonal expansions.
