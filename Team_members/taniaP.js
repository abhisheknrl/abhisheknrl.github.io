		<h4><strong>T&acirc;nia Peniche, MSc</strong></h4>
		PhD Student<br><br>
		<p style="font-size:80%;">
			T&acirc;nia joined the lab in 2024 and began her PhD in 2025. Her project focuses on understanding the genomic basis of sex bias in clonal hematopoiesis and blood malignancies. Using computational approaches, she investigates how genetic and molecular factors contribute to the development of hematopoietic clones, with particular interest in the role of sex-specific mutation patterns.
            She earned her Master's degree in Bioinformatics and Computational Biology from NOVA University Lisbon, where her thesis explored the clinical impact of high-throughput molecular data in sarcoma patient care. During this time, she developed a strong interest in bioinformatics, precision medicine, and cancer biology. Her PhD work integrates these fields to uncover molecular mechanisms driving disease, with the long-term goal of helping develop more personalized treatments for patients.
