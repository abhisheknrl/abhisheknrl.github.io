		<h4><strong>Yajuan Huang, MSc</strong></h4>
		PhD Student<br><br>
		<p style="font-size:80%;">
			Yajuan joined the lab as a PhD student in 2023. Her research focuses on uncovering novel genetic drivers of clonal hematopoiesis by integrating large-scale whole-genome sequencing data, with an emphasis on both myeloid and lymphoid lineages, and combining somatic and germline genetics, mutational signatures, and clinical data to stratify disease risk.
            She obtained her Master's degree in Bioinformatics from Lund University in 2023. Her Master's project investigated the genetic basis of host-plant adaptation in Tephritis conura using whole-genome sequencing and host-associated transcriptomic analyses, revealing phenotypic plasticity as the primary adaptation mechanism with limited host-associated genomic differentiation.
